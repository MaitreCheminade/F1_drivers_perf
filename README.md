# F1 drivers ability measurement 

This is a purely personal project.   
The question it tries to answer is :   

**Among a list of drivers with performances measured as laptimes during races, 
and accounting for external factors such as rain, tyre compound and wear, position (traffic), team, circuit, etc. 
which driver is the best, i.e. is associated with the shortest laptimes ?**
